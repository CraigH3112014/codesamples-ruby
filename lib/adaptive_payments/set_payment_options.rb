# # SetPaymentOptions API
# You use the SetPaymentOptions API operation to specify settings for a payment of the actionType `CREATE`. This actionType is specified in the PayRequest message.
# This sample code uses AdaptivePayments Ruby SDK to make API call. You can download the SDK [here](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/tree/gh-pages/adaptivepayments-sdk/ruby)
