# # Pay API
# Use the Pay API operation to transfer funds from a sender's PayPal account to one or more receivers' PayPal accounts. You can use the Pay API operation to make simple payments, chained payments, or parallel payments; these payments can be explicitly approved, preapproved, or implicitly approved.
# This sample code uses AdaptivePayments Ruby SDK to make API call. You can download the SDK [here](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/tree/gh-pages/adaptivepayments-sdk/ruby)

      # combination with ExecutePayment.
      # * CREATE - Use this option to set up the payment instructions with
      # SetPaymentOptions and then execute the payment at a later time with
      # the ExecutePayment.
      # * PAY_PRIMARY - For chained payments only, specify this value to delay
