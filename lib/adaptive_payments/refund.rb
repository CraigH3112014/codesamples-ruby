# # Refund API
# Use the Refund API operation to refund all or part of a payment.
# This sample code uses AdaptivePayments Ruby SDK to make API call. You can download the SDK [here](https://www.x.com/developers/paypal/documentation-tools/paypal-sdk-index)

        # 
        # * REFUNDED - Refund successfully completed
        # * REFUNDED_PENDING - Refund awaiting transfer of funds;
        # for example, a refund paid by eCheck.
        # * NOT_PAID - Payment was never made; therefore, it cannot
        # be refunded.
        # * ALREADY_REVERSED_OR_REFUNDED - Request rejected because
        # the refund was already made, or the payment was reversed
        # prior to this request.
        # * NO_API_ACCESS_TO_RECEIVER - Request cannot be completed
        # because you do not have third-party access from the
        # receiver to make the refund.
        # * REFUND_NOT_ALLOWED - Refund is not allowed.
        # * INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE - Request rejected because the
        # receiver from which the refund is to be paid does not
        # have sufficient funds or the funding source cannot be
        # used to make a refund.
        # * AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_REFUNDABLE - Request rejected because
        # you attempted to refund more than the remaining amount of the
        # payment; call the PaymentDetails API operation to
        # determine the amount already refunded.
        # * PREVIOUS_REFUND_PENDING - Request rejected because a
        # refund is currently pending for this part of the payment
        # * NOT_PROCESSED - Request rejected because it cannot be
        # processed at this time
        # * REFUND_ERROR - Request rejected because of an internal
        # error
        # * PREVIOUS_REFUND_ERROR - Request rejected because
        # another part of this refund caused an internal error.
