# # DoReferenceTransaction API
# The DoReferenceTransaction API operation processes a payment from a buyer's account, which is identified by a previous transaction.
# This sample code uses Merchant Ruby SDK to make API call. You can download the SDK [here](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/tree/gh-pages/merchant-sdk/ruby)
